## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result in your local environment.


## Process
- Converted a Figma Design template into a website using HTML, CSS, Javascript and CSS Framework Bootstrap.
- Created Next.js app using NPM (Node Package Manager)
- Converted website into next.js app
- Fetched products listing from an RESTful API using Axios.



## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
