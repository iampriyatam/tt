This is project developed using these technologies:
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)

## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result in your local environment.


## Process
- Converted a Figma Design template into a website using HTML, CSS, Javascript and CSS Framework Bootstrap.
- Created Next.js app using NPM (Node Package Manager)
- Converted website into next.js app
- Fetched products listing from an RESTful API using Axios.
- Used Netify to deploy this app seamlessly.

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Netlify Platform](https://www.netlify.com/)
